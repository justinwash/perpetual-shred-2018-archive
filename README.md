# PerpetualShred
Never-ending gnar.

Perpetual Shred is a combination of two projects:

1. A web-crawler that searches a set of websites for sick mountain bike shredits, and
2. A web site that by-default displays these videos randomly and endlessly with a nice looking single-page interface.

Getting set up:

1. Install Node.js
2. Install dependencies (React, React-Video, Webpack, Babel):
 
  npm install --save react react-dom react-video
  
  npm install --save-dev webpack babel-loader babel-core babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react
  
  npm install webpack-dev-server –g

3. Check that 'webpack' is present in your pre-build commands (if you want to bundle automatically on build).
